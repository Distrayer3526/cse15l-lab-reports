# First CSE15L lab report

First we had to go on UCSD's Educational Technology Servies webpage and reset our password

* We had to find our CSE15L specific username
* We then had to use that username to do the account lookup
* Then we made a new password and waited 15 min

I had already used VS Code in another class so I had that installed

* This is what you see when you open VS code for the first time
* Since I used it for CSE 12 I had my code from that class open first so I had to make a new window

Git was something new so I had to go through the steps to get that set up in the terminal

* In the .exe file I had to use all the defualt settings and it installed multiple applications on my computer
* One of my lab mates help me get familiar with git bash and link it up with this repo

At this point I ran my first SSH command and after putting in my password I got this result

* It was interesting how the password doesn't show up when you type it

To see if everything was running fine a ran some commands and luckily everything was working fine

* I first checked to see what files were there in my account but then I tried going as far out as I could using the change directory command

Then finally I setup my first ever Github repo which is what I used to make this webpage

* This makes the whole HTML aspect of making a webpage so much easier
